          {" "}
          This privacy policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) describes how the personally
          identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) you may
          provide on the{" "}

          website (&quot;Website&quot; or &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its
          related products and services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;) is
          collected, protected and used. It also describes the choices available
          to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can
          access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding
          agreement between you (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or
          &quot;your&quot;) and this Website operator (&quot;Operator&quot;,
          &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). By accessing and
          using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
          understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This
          Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own
          or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
        </p>
        <h2>Collection of information</h2>
        <p>
          Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise
          the no logs policy. We may process only minimal user data, only as
          much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Website and
          Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify
          potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information
          regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This
          statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that
          would identify any particular user of the system.
        </p>
        <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
        <p>
          In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet
          a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal
          Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we
          may not be able to provide you with the requested products or
          services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used to
          help us run and operate the Website and Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with
          the Website and Services, where you are located in the world and if
          one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one
          or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the
          processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer
          Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of
          information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you
          and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing
          is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are
          subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in
          the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
          us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
          interests pursued by us or by a third party.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
          information until you object to such processing (by opting out),
          without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal
          bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific
          legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether
          the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual
          requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
        </p>
        <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any
          transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share
          your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that
          work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to
          assist in the operation of the Website and Services available to you.
          We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties.
          These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your
          information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or
          comply with legal requirements. We may share your Personal Information
          for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are
          consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with
          respect to Personal Information. These third parties are given
          Personal Information they need only in order to perform their
          designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose
          Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>Retention of information</h2>
        <p>
          We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period
          necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
          enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or
          permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or
          incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it,
          but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the
          retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted.
          Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
          rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
          after the expiration of the retention period.
        </p>
        <h2>Transfer of information</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring
          and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are
          entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a
          country outside the European Union or to any international
          organization governed by public international law or set up by two or
          more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken
          by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place,
          you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy
          or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact
          section.
        </p>
        <h2>The rights of users</h2>
        <p>
          You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed
          by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you
          have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given
          your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the
          right to object to the processing of your information if the
          processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii)
          you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us,
          obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and
          obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have
          the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to
          be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain
          circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in
          which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other
          than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances,
          to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you
          have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly
          used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have
          it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This
          provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by
          automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a
          contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations
          thereof.
        </p>
        <h2>The right to object to processing</h2>
        <p>
          Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in
          the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes
          of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
          processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation
          to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your
          Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you
          can object to that processing at any time without providing any
          justification. To learn whether we are processing Personal Information
          for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections
          of this document.

          In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California
          residents who provide Personal Information (as defined in the statute)
          to obtain products or services for personal, family, or household use
          are entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year,
          information about the Personal Information we shared, if any, with
          other businesses for marketing uses. If applicable, this information
          would include the categories of Personal Information and the names and
          addresses of those businesses with which we shared such personal
          information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests
          made in the current year will receive information about the prior
          year). To obtain this information please contact us.
        </p>
        <h2>How to exercise these rights</h2>
        <p>
          Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to the Operator

          you are the authorized representative of such person. You must include
          sufficient details to allow us to properly understand the request and
          respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with
          Personal Information unless we first verify your identity or authority
          to make such a request and confirm that the Personal Information
          relates to you.
        </p>
        <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
        <p>
          We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with
          respect to Personal Information we may collect from children and take
          many special precautions to protect the privacy of children. We do not
          require any Personal Information from them at any time. We encourage
          children to consult with their parents before submitting any
          information to any online resource . We believe parents should be
          involved in the online activities of their children and suggest that
          parents do their best to provide their children with a safe and
          friendly online environment.
        </p>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          The Website and Services use &quot;cookies&quot; to help personalize
          your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your
          hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs

        <p>
          We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for
          statistical purposes to operate the Website and Services. You have the
          ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
          accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to

        <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
        <p>
          Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
          websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
          tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information
          in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
          collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use
          or visit a website or online service as they move across different
          websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal
          is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet
          set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by
          your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this
          Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.
        </p>
        <h2>Advertisements</h2>
        <p>
          We may display online advertisements and we may share aggregated and
          non-identifying information about our customers that we or our
          advertisers collect through your use of the Website and Services. We
          do not share personally identifiable information about individual
          customers with advertisers. In some instances, we may use this
          aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored
          advertisements to the intended audience.
        </p>
        <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
        <p>
          The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not
          owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible
          for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We
          encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and
          to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may
          collect Personal Information.
        </p>
        <h2>Information security</h2>
        <p>
          We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled,
          secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or
          disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and
          physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized
          access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in
          its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the
          Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we
          strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i)
          there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are
          beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any
          and all information and data exchanged between you and the Website and
          Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data
          may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite
          best efforts.
        </p>
        <h2>Data breach</h2>
        <p>
          In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and
          Services has been compromised or users Personal Information has been
          disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
          including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve
          the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not
          limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to
          and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a
          data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected
          individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to
          the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required
          by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Website.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
